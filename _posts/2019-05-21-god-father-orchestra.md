*Godfather BGMs and scenes deserving to be memorize*

I have watched God Father many times these years. As the must-watching movie for man, I have to say, it is a must indeed, violent but a little bit touching and having the ability to educate how to make boys men, a turely man.

Let us remember God Father again by enjoying its backgroup music.

### BGMs

#### 1. The Godfather â€“ Orchestral Suite. - The Danish National Symphony Orchestra (Live)
