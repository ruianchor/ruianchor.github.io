When waked up at 8 o'clock this morning, I decided to **dive into** the sea of books, so I choosed Pudong library as my target.

As I walked along on the way to Pudong library, I started to appreciate the lovely views along the road. When I raised my head, this is the <font color="yellow">magnificent</font> sky I saw.

Hope you enjoy it!
