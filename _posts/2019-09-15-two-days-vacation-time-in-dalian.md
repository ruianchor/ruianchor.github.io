This short vacation began for an idea coming into my mind in a hard-to-sleep night.
<br>
<br>

In this week, we had only four days for work because of the Chinese traditional Mid-Autumn Festival. So the weekend starts when off-work on Thursday. Maybe it's exactly the reason to make me have no willing to fall asleep that there are three days to fly myself, which means *放飞自我* in Chinese. Do something different would be a better choice instead of just staying at home in a normal way - playing computer games, watching tv series et al. So this is how it all begins.
<br>
<br>

I booked a ticket flying to Dalian from Shanghai with my iPhone. The next day, it is Friday, the airplane I took in started off at 12:05 pm. It was nearly 15:30 pm when I arrived at my hotel room, which also means it still has half-day left on Friday. Unfortunately, it rains outside in Dalian when I got to. And I really do think this vacation would be suck before Saturday's morning coming. Anyway, as has been here, no matter how the weather outside is, I still need to visit those famous viewpoints in Dalian.

### Stars Bay

After I checked in my hotel, The **Stars Bay**, which is a not-too-long seashore, was the first destination I visited since the reason it being nearby my hotel, only 15 mins walking from it. Nevertheless it had little rain in the sky, there were still so many tourists going to Stars Bay. Two things impressed me the most, one was many local people were taking fishing there, another one was several men were swimming in the sea. Of course, many tourists were the local families - parents with their little boys and little girls.

### Tiger Beach Park

It turned out everything was nice at the moment that I waked up in the morning of Saturday - it's pretty big sunshine outside, really suit for having fun along the beach.

#### 1. In the Bird Singing Woods

After taking the 2 minutes' cable car to cross the bayou, finally got onto the Bird Singing Woods, so many diifferent birds coming from all over the world singing there.

#### 2. Taking the yacht
The seawater in Dalian is literally no impurities, like a pearl under the sun, shining and smelling so good. Standing at the board, feeding the flying seagulls and watching them eat the food we throw into the sky and the sea, everyone in the yacht cheers when seagulls happened to have the food at the moment we throw it into the sky. People, sea, seagull, yacht, sky, cloud, island, everything seems so harmouny at that time.

### Binhai Road
It was 15:30 when finished visiting all scenic spots in the Tiger Beach Park. I thought it would be a more unforgettable experience that just went hiking to the hotel, which is 3 hours walk distance from the Tiger Beach, as my flight back to Shanghai took off at 21:00, still had enough time left, it turned out that it was the right choice to just walking.

Some momonts in this trip, in my views, had the magic to invoke the sentiments and the feelings to touch the real life.
