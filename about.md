### Brief biography
I grew up in Hubei, China but have always been loving to travel around, and have since lived in Xianning, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Shanghai. Here's a more <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cities" style="color:rgb(0,0,255)">comprehensive list</a> of where I've spent time.

<br />
I spend most of my free time reading and hiking for facilitating and freshing my mind and keeping fit. Besides that, cooking is one of my favorite things to do. I love playing online games, listening to podcasts, exploring new music, and sometimes writing as well.

### Miscellaneous

#### PUZZLES
Began to be into solving puzzles since graduated from school. Below are some of my favorites - and you should know I have the answer.üò∏üçª

#### SELF-INTERROGATION
There is life-changing power in regular self-inquiry.

<br />
<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; background-color:#AFEEEE; padding: 0.5em;"><strong>Am I happy?</strong> <br>I would like to start with some yes or no questions to assess how I feel. I don't spend too much time answering these - I know that my first response is usually my truest one.</p><br>
