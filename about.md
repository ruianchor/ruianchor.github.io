### Brief biography
I grew up in Hubei, China but have always been loving to travel around, and have since lived in Xianning, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Shanghai. Here's a more <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cities" style="color:rgb(0,0,255)">comprehensive list</a> of where I've spent time.

<br />
I spend most of my free time reading and hiking for facilitating and freshing my mind and keeping fit. Besides that, cooking is one of my favorite things to do. I love playing online games, listening to podcasts, exploring new music, and sometimes writing as well.

### Miscellaneous

#### PUZZLES
Began to be into solving puzzles since graduated from school. Below are some of my favorites - and you should know I have the answer.üò∏üçª

<br />
<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#DAA520; background-color:#87CEFA; padding: 0.5em;"><strong>The Parking Lot:</strong> What is the number of the parking space containing the car? <br><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/parking.gif" width="240" height="400"/></p><br>
<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#DAA520; background-color:#87CEFA; padding: 0.5em;"><strong>Cheryl's Birthday:</strong>Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them 10 possible dates: May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17. Cheryl tells Albert the month, and Bernard the day. First Albert says: "I don't know Cheryl's birthday, but Bernard does not know as well!". Bernard then says: "Now I know Cheryl's birthday, and so does Albert!". When is her birthday?</p>&nbsp;
<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#DAA520; background-color:#87CEFA; padding: 0.5em;"><strong>Forty-five Minutes:</strong>How do we measure forty-five minutes using two wires, each of which takes an hour to burn. Unfortunately, the wires burn non-uniformly (sometimes faster, sometimes slower). We have plenty of matchsticks.</p>

#### SELF-INTERROGATION
There is life-changing power in regular self-inquiry.

<br />
<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#DAA520; background-color:#87CEFA; padding: 0.5em;"><strong>Am I happy?</strong> <br>I would like to start with some yes or no questions to assess how I feel. I don't spend too much time answering these - I know that my first response is usually my truest one.</p><br>

<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#DAA520; background-color:#87CEFA; padding: 0.5em;"><strong>Am I grateful?</strong> <br>I remind myself all the time to appreciate what I have. This question prompts me to do that.</p>
