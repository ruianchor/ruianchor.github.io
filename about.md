### Brief biography
I grew up in Hubei, China but have always been loving to travel around, and have since lived in Xianning, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Shanghai. Here's a more <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cities" style="color:rgb(0,0,255)">comprehensive list</a> of where I've spent time.

<br />
With catholic tastes, I spend most of my free time reading and hiking for facilitating and freshing my mind and keeping fit. Besides that, cooking is one of my favorite things to do. I love playing online games, listening to podcasts, exploring new music, and sometimes writing as well.
