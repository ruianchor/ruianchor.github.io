### Brief biography
I grew up in Hubei, China but have always been loving to travel around, and have since lived in Xianning, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Shanghai. Here's a more <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cities" style="color:rgb(0,0,255)">comprehensive list</a> of where I've spent time. In a word, I am a man with catholic tastes, always being into exploring new things.
