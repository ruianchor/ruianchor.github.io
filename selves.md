You might have known who I am, where I have been, and how I live my life. Below questions would facilitate to understand me better literally.

### 1. Am I happy?
You know that the first response is usually the truest one.

### 2. Am I grateful?
This question prompts me to appreciate what I have.

### 3. Do I like my job?
We spend most of our time at work, so it’s important to feel good about what we do.

### 4. Do I feel good?
When I’m in a good mental and emotional place, I’m better equipped to connect with the people in my life. That’s why I work on my own energy before trying to help others.

### 5. What new things am I learning?
If I don’t have a good answer for this one, I know it’s time to make a change. When I’m not learning, I’m not growing, and when I’m not growing, I feel frustrated and weak.

### 6. How can I help one person today?
My life has more meaning when I do something generous with my time. For example, held door for a middle-age foreign lady and a young family with a baby, in return, I obtained a "thank you" and a kind smile respectively.
